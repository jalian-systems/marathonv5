   When a module or a fixture file changes, Ruby interpreter is reloaded
   so that the changes are visible.

   When a select() is called on a non-editable tree node, a proper error
   message is shown.

13. Using UTF8 for compiling Java sources.
14. execute_script - toString() on return value
    driver.execute_script was returning null when the return value is not one of
    the known data types. We do a Object#toString() on it now.
15. Selecting first row in tableView. (FX)
    We were using selectIndices() which considers 0 as invalid value.
16. fix: Using UTF8 for compiling Java sources.
    Some of the test helper methods use UTF8 characters and do not compile
    when the encoding is not set.
